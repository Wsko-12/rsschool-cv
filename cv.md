## About Me
I started programming at the beginning of quarantine. Most of all I was engaged in the creation of web game dev. 
Fast learner. Used to work as a dental technician. A lot of work was related to 3D programs so I have a very good understanding of 3D. 
My previous job brought me up as a perfectionist therefore I am very attentive in every case.
I want my hobby to become a profession.
